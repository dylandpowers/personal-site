- 3 types of conversations:
  1. Practical (what is this really about?)
  2. Emotional (how do we feel?)
  3. Social (who are we?)
- We need to match the conversation type to whoever we are talking to, or else there will be clashes.
- Two types of logic in a conversation:
  1. Cost/benefit logic
  2. Similarity logic (empathy)
