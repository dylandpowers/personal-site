- 3 types of conversations:
  1. Practical (what is this really about?)
  2. Emotional (how do we feel?)
  3. Social (who are we?)
- We need to match the conversation type to whoever we are talking to, or else there will be clashes.
- Two types of logic in a conversation:
  1. Cost/benefit logic (analytical)
  2. Similarity logic (emotional)
- Try to find out what kind of logic the other person finds appealing.
  - Are they presenting facts? If so, they are using analytical logic.
  - Are they presenting feelings? If so, they are using emotional logic.
- "How do we feel" conversations are powerful in getting others to open up.
  - Ask lots of questions, listen to their struggles, and be vulnerable.
- Show a desire to be on the same wavelength as someone else.
  - Try to match their _mood_ and _energy_.
- The loop:
  1. Ask questions.
  2. Repeat what you heard.
  3. Ask if you got it right.
- In arguments, we often want to maintain control.
  - In healthy relationships, people try to control their emotions, the environment, and the boundaries of the conversation.
- In "who are we" conversations, try to bring out the person's distinct identity.
- Difficult conversations often threaten our sense of self.
  - Try to embrace this, know it is going to be tough, and accept it.
- Bringing up differences allows us to show our true selves.
