- This book isn't about caring about nothing, but rather being more selective about the things that you care about.
- You should only care about things that align with your personal values, and kick everything else to the curb.
- If you can not give a f\*ck about the struggle that will lead to accomplishing your goals, you will win.
- Some suffering is inevitable - a life without it is a fairy tale.
- You have to love the process - the pain and suffering that will lead to greatness.
- Once you run out of problems, your brain will invent new problems. The key to happiness is to find problems you enjoy solving.
- If something threatens your identity, you will do everything in your power to avoid it.
- "200 crappy words per day" - when you choose action as your metric for success, then merely doing anything is a step in the right direction. If you always wait for inspiration or have your metric for success be perfection, you'll never make progress.
- We are all going to die some day. We shouldn't be scared of this, but rather we should embrace it as a reason to go for it.
- The paradox of choice: the more choices we have, the more we are likely to feel regret after making a choice. This is why commitment is a beautiful thing.
