I live in New York City and I code for a living.

# Work

Since graduating (remotely) in May 2020, I have been writing code and building cool stuff.

### [Addepar](https://addepar.com), November 2021 - June 2023

Full stack on the billing team. Also did some developer tools work.

### [Yext](https://yext.com), June 2020 - November 2021

Full stack in the knowledge graph org. Building a single source of truth for businesses everywhere.

# Side

On the side, I build web apps for all sorts of purposes. I write a lot of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

# Life

I am a huge Denver sports fan, all across the board. I travel a lot and usually go to a couple EDM festivals every year.
