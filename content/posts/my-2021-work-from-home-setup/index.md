My company has allowed us to return to the office on a voluntary basis (requiring proof of vaccination). I go every day because I really value being able to discuss something easily without having to set up a Zoom meeting. Also, how could anybody possibly say no to free snacks and coffee?

Despite the abundant nourishment, there is one thing I miss about the roughly 10 months of work-from-home that I did - my setup! I spent a lot of time researching and refining my setup, so I want to share it with the world.

# Monitors

For monitors, I have two 27" LG 27UL500-W 4K monitors ([Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PGL2WVS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)). I have them mounted using a [dual arm mount](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MC9YX63/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), which allows me to move them around very easily. 

Having used both 4K and non-4K monitors, I will say that 4K is 100% worth the extra price. Even moving to a 1440p monitor feels so much different after experiencing 4K resolution for so long.

As far as configuration, I have one monitor directly in front of me and one directly to the right of it, tilted toward me. Currently, both are horizontal, but I had the right one oriented vertically for about half of WFH. It was really useful for code, but I still find that it is easier to manage multiple applications when viewing them horizontally.

I also have my laptop on the left side of my desk on a simple [laptop stand](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00WRDS0AU/ref=twister_B011KOHEXU?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1).

# Mouse

I had a very cheap $10 mouse for most of WFH, which treated me well. However, until I upgraded, I never knew what I was missing out on. I recently bought the Logitech MX Master 3 ([Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S395RWD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)), and it completely changed the game. The ergonomics are absolutely incredible, it's configurable beyond belief, and it has a horizontal scroll wheel (more handy than you might think). 

I have an [extended mousepad](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0788LMLZL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that I also put my keyboard on. It has seen it's fair share of spills, so it may be time to replace it soon.

# Keyboard

Currently, I am using the Apple Magic Keyboard with an additional numeric keypad ([Apple](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQ052LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-us-english?fnode=edc42abb786ca1b7773285f06ef4610205228b9440553044f8e33d9f6aacde9535ba3fb4de8dad2b0540af00cc109e1163d4b5034aeb948dbfdc77b548cdc35bc4ae83b7561abec3b4bed8fce2bf38470ef05c57ccb31b557667784673f5319a)). I have it in black, which matches my mouse and mouse pad exquisitely. I have thought a lot about upgrading to a mechanical soon. I ordered a switch tester (big brown fan) and will order once I feel that I have researched enough.

# Camera

I have the Logitech C922x Pro Stream Webcam ([Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LXCDPPK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)) sitting on top of the monitor directly in front of me. It has excellent video quality, but the part that really surprised me is the audio quality. It comes with a built-in microphone that works incredibly well.

My setup is always a work in progress, but I feel that I have made a good start. There's just a few more things that I need - plants, plants, and more plants!
